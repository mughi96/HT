Hash Table Guide:


- This webpage contains a simple visualisation to demonstrate the working principles of a Hash Table. 

- The hash table is an array of length 17, with each index containing a pointer to a secondary 
  array of length 3 to store colliding data. 

- This panel on the right will serve as a guide on navigating this visualisation tool. 



Below the hash table, the hash function used is displayed, where: 
	c = character code
	a = large prime number (7919)
	k = length of string



1. INSERT: Type a string (max 10 characters) into the input field and press ‘INSERT’. 


	- Once “INSERT” has been pressed, look below the Hash Function equation to watch the hashing
	- After the hash value has been calculated, the string will appear in the table, before moving into their 
	  respective arrays	
	- If collisions occur, the string will be stored in the next index of the secondary array
	- Repeat this step to populate the table with more strings. 


2. DELETE: To remove a string from the table, type the string into input field and press “DELETE”.


3. FIND: To locate a string within the table, type the string into the input field and press “FIND”.
